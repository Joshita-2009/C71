         I like this place because knowing the features of old temples is great they say that the first sun rise in India happened here before there was sea at the side of the temple now it is moved there was sun dial as the wheels of the temple. The temple was built as a chariot on which sun is sitting his riding the horses the lions at the starting show us the ferocious rulers of that time and there bravery they say that there was a magnet at the top of the temple it was kept by a little boy who was the child of the construction captain. The king had said the all the work has to be done by the labourers if not they will be killed so the little boy heard that and killed himself from the top of the temple. I suggest you to visit the place there are so many intresting things you can know about the temple. See for yourself and enjoy.

    <h4>Scarcity of Water</h4>
    <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="Scarcity of water.jpg">
    <p class="list-group-item-text">More than 2,500 years ago, when the Indus Valley Civi­lisation had reached its zenith, it mysteriously lost its effulgence and disappeared suddenly. Many archaeologi­sts believe it was due to a catastrophic water scarcity caused either by shifting rivers or by drastic climate change that forced people to abandon city settlements. The civilisation all but vanished except for the ruins it left behind, which were discovered only in the 20th century.


      Ominously for India, history seems to be repeating itself. A NITI Aayog report in 2018 stated bluntly that 600 million people, or nearly half of India’s population, face extreme water stress. That three-fourths of India’s rural households do not have piped, potable water and rely on sources that pose a serious health risk. That India has become the world’s largest extractor of groundwater, accounting for 25 per cent of the total. That 70 per cent of our sources are contaminated and our major rivers are dying because of pollution. Its conclusion: ‘India is suffering from its worst water crisis in its history.’</p>

    <p>When it comes to humour, there’s not one kind of it that’ll tickle everyone’s funny bone. Some like it subtle, some slapstick, and then there are those who like it situational, while others prefer roasts. But, there’s also the category who love to laugh their sorrows away with cliché funny message forwards about how difficult marital life really is. That is the category Anil Ravipudi is presumably looking to tap into with this film, which is filled with dialogues that truly do sound like finely tuned forwards.</p>

    <p>With Sarileru Neekevvaru, Anil Ravipudi brings back the old Mahesh Babu, someone who played cocky characters that fought, danced, saved the day and delivered speeches seeped in morality. There’s enough drama, emotion and most importantly, looming danger in the film (until Mahesh Babu saves the day) to fuel the wafer-thin story, but Anil is so caught up in weaving two mismatched story-lines together that he forgets to keep the repetitiveness in check. He banks on you to suspend disbelief for the most part and given as how the film doesn’t take itself too seriously in the first place, it might work for some</p>

<p>One of the longest books in the world, the 'Mahabharata' tells the story of a country, a culture, and a family tearing itself apart. In ancient India, it was said that nothing exists which is not within its pages. This hubristic claim hints at the fatigue which sets in if you try to absorb it in one go.
